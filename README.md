==> Instructions for setting the site up:
---------------------------------------------
1. Download Jdeveloper, NetBeans, Eclipse.
Note: I was thinking of what is the best to build my project.
2. Create new GitHub repository: https://github.com/StevaJ/hotel-deals-expedia
3. Create new application on Heroku with the name 'hoteldexpedia'
4. Download SmartGit tool
5. Clone the repository using SmartGit 
6. Create new application using JDeveloper which contains one JSP file and one servlet.

Note: The application builded on JDeveloper is very simple and it 
dose not cover all the required things of this task.

==> Assumptions :
-----------------
I thought about solving this task in more than one option.
I first thought of solving this by using JDeveloper application and parse the JSON file 
from the servlet method. I also thought to do it from the JSP file it self by using JQuery techniques.

I think the best way of solving this task is java restfull web service.
I tried thinking about this option by using Eclipse with Spring framework following these links:
http://www.java2blog.com/2015/09/how-to-create-dynamic-web-project-using.html
https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/


I searched for some links to show how to build an web app from scratch since 
I never did that before. The same goes for JSON to be honest with you I tried 
to build a complete application for this task but I think I need more time 
because am not really familiar with JSON because I always use an SQL database 
at my current work.



==> General Assumptions were not made on this task:
I thing this kind of applications it allow us to think of many features that helps the customer to find a beter offer.
one of the things I thought about was a 'distanceFromUser' we could make a button which detect the user location 
and try to search for nearest hotels. We could help the customer findig a good car rating from the same hotel, we 
could also add an option to find what are the nearest restaurants and hospitals to the chosen hotel.
